        <h3>What is HTML &amp; CSS?</h3>
        <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language</i> and is the backbone of web content. HTML formats text in a way that allows browsers to properly display your content. By using this universal code, all browsers can read and display webpages from all around the world.</p>
        <p><b>CSS,</b> or <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, styles your html content. Through CSS, you can choose specific fonts, colors, and locations for your content. You can also add other stylistic elements such as background pictures, buttons, and boxes with drop shadows to further style your content. CSS can take a rather plain webpage and make it look more like a work of art.</p>
